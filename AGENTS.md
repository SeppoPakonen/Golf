## UML Class Diagrams

The system architecture is documented with UML class diagrams that illustrate the relationships between different components of the Rude Engine and the Golf game implementation.

- [Rude Engine Core Classes Diagram](rude_engine_classes.puml)
- [Rude Engine Physics Classes Diagram](rude_physics_classes.puml) 
- [Golf Example Application Classes Diagram](golf_example_classes.puml)
- [Rude Engine Utility Classes Diagram](rude_utilities_classes.puml)

For detailed information about each diagram, see [UML_DIAGRAMS.md](UML_DIAGRAMS.md).

## System Agents and Components

The system consists of several key agents/components:

1. **Rude Engine Core**: Provides basic game engine functionality
2. **Physics System**: Handles physics simulation and collision detection
3. **Rendering System**: Manages graphics rendering via OpenGL
4. **Input System**: Processes user input from various platforms
5. **Golf Game Logic**: Implements the specific golf game mechanics
